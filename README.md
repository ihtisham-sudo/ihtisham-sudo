# IhtishamSudo - Smart Contract Security Auditor & Researcher

I'm an independent Smart Contract Security Researcher and Auditor, dedicated to identifying vulnerabilities in decentralized applications and conducting in-depth analyses of EVM protocols. My expertise spans across Solidity and Rust, with a deep understanding of the EVM ecosystem. I specialize in auditing logic-heavy protocols, cross-chain systems, staking mechanisms, and various DeFi primitives, while also actively researching their core algorithms, designs, governance, timelocks, and multisig mechanisms.

I am available for private smart contract security audits, testing, Research and collaborative team audits. Feel free to reach out via Twitter/Telegram.

## Security Research & Articles

I actively engage in in-depth research of EVM protocols, their core algorithms, designs, governance, timelocks, and multisig mechanisms. My research covers over 150 EVM protocols, which are categorized and analyzed on [SCAuditStudio.com](https://scauditstudio.com/categories).

I also contribute to the blockchain security community through written articles, published on the [SCAuditStudio blog](https://scauditstudio.com/blog).
